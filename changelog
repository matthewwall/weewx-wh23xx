* deal with situation where no light sensor is attached

0.11 11jan2017
* do uv-to-uvi conversion for historical records using fine offset function
* do not divide uv by 1000.0 - leave it in uW/m^2

0.10 03jan2017
* renamed light to luminosity for database, not for hardware naming
* use luminosity to determine radiation until we figure what what uv really is
